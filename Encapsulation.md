Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into a single component.
Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside. Only the object can interact with its internal data. Public methods can be created to open a defined way to access the logic inside an object.
Encapsulation reduce system complexity and increase robustness by decoupling its components.

Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into a single component. The features of encapsulation are supported using classes in most object-oriented programming languages, although other alternatives also exist. It allows selective hiding of properties and methods in an object by building an impenetrable wall to protect the code from accidental corruption.

Definition (from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4772956/encapsulation-concept)
Encapsulation means that a class publishes only what is needed for others to use it, and no more. This is called information hiding and it means classes can totally change their internals without having an effect on any of their users.
In an object oriented world, objects hold both their data and the methods used to manipulate data and that is the pinnacle of encapsulation. One way this is done is to make sure each object knows which functions to call to manipulate its data, and ensure the correct ones are called.
